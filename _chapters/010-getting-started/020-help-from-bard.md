Bard and ChatGPT are new at this time and I wanted to use them to get job pathway together for learning. 

I generated a short outline on how I went about and prepared my workflow.

### Step 1: Customize your AI chatbot

With Bard/ChatGPT, it is possible to create personas for the AI assistant. 

- For example, Prompt the AI assistant to act as an experienced and knowledgeable 'Bookkeeping' teacher. I am a beginner and would like information, preferably free that will help me learn bookkeeping.

### Step 2: Formulate a learning strategy

Request the AI chatbot to create a topic learning roadmap or outline based on your specific learning objectives. Have the AI chatbot provide a list of learning goals.


### Step 3: Exploring Advanced Tools

Try employing tools like AutoGPT. AutoGPT has the capability to generate a comprehensive course curriculum tailored to an individualâ€™s specific needs and requirements. Experimenting with AutoGPT to see the curriculum it generates might be worth considering.

### Step 4: Engaging in practical projects

If individuals are already proficient in a topic, they may opt to directly engage in a project rather than following a structured course.
